# Cybersecurity Write-Ups (TryHackMe + Labs)

This repository is a curated collection of my hands-on cybersecurity investigations, labs, and case studies.  
Write-ups are provided in two styles when helpful:

- **Student/Training Write-Up** — clear, step-by-step, beginner-friendly.
- **Professional Report** — structured like an analyst report (good for GRC / IR / SOC roles).

## Contents

- **OSINT**
  - **Sakura Room (TryHackMe)** — Open-source intelligence case study covering identity pivoting, dark-web paste reconstruction, WiFi geolocation, blockchain tracing, and travel/imagery analysis.

- **Password Attacks**
  - **Hydra (TryHackMe)** — Practical walkthrough of brute-forcing weak credentials using Hydra against web forms (HTTP POST) and SSH services, including analysis of failure responses and credential validation.

> **Disclaimer**  
> These write-ups are for educational and defensive training purposes only.  
> Any “attacker” identities, credentials, or infrastructure referenced are part of simulated training scenarios.
