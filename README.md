 Cybersecurity Write-Ups (TryHackMe + Labs)
This repository is a curated collection of my hands-on cybersecurity investigations, labs, and case studies.
Write-ups are provided in two styles when helpful:

Student/Training Write-Up — clear, step-by-step, beginner-friendly.
Professional Report — structured like an analyst report (good for GRC / IR / SOC roles).
Contents
OSINT
Aiko Abe Investigation (TryHackMe) — Open-source intelligence case study covering identity pivoting, dark‑web paste reconstruction, WiFi geolocation, blockchain tracing, and travel/imagery analysis.
Disclaimer
These write-ups are for educational and defensive training purposes only.
Any “attacker” identities, credentials, or infrastructure referenced are part of simulated training scenarios.
